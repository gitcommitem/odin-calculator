## Learnings

This was a really great project in terms of learning and solidfying all the concepts that I've learned so far. 

A lot of my issues at the beginning were due to not putting variables in the correct local scope.

I had a troubleshooting session with my mentors and was introduced to replit and found it to be a really great sandbox area for me to work out code to at least check if my logic was sound before going back to the main code to figure out where my code was breaking.

Thinking through the calculator logic was fun and also finding all the possible conditions that would throw errors was good practice.

The TOP instructions didn't require the calculator to follow PEMDAS but I decided to add PEMDAS to my calculator.
